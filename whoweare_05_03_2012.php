<p class="mainContent" style="padding:30px;padding-top:0px;line-height:2.2em;">
Here you will find a complete online wedding photography service that can be tailored to meet your individual wedding requirements.<br />
We can provide a complete photography service where we can provide you with a choice of professional wedding photographers, and a complete wedding photo hosting and printing service, or you can bring your images to us and we can service all of your printing needs including albums, framed prints, canvas prints, as well as many other printing options including printing on metal.<br />
ModPix is an on-line business that gives you chances to re-live and share cherished moments.<br />
We don't take photos just so later they will be forgotten on a disc or in a folder. These memories need to be shared and enjoyed, displayed, on a holiday card, under a gallery light or in a wedding album.<br />
Our professional products, timely service and excellent prices help bring your cherished moments and your creativity to life with products that will amaze everyone and bring back wonderful moments and memories online and in print.<br />
We are an Australian owned company based in Sydney. Our commitment is to provide a high level of service and commitment dedicated to serving the wedding photography industry in Australia.<br />
You want your images to dazzle-whether on a canvas cover or a gallery-size metal print. We work to create products that look and feel good in your hands or on a wall. High quality shouldn't mean high prices. <br />
We love a challenge and constantly innovate to bring you excellent value and products.
